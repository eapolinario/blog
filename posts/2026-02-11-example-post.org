#+DESCRIPTION: An example post demonstrating the structure and philosophy of Liminal Desiderata

* Introduction

This is an example post for /Liminal Desiderata/. It demonstrates the structure of a typical essay: org-mode source files that transform into clean, semantic HTML.

The blog lives at thresholds—between what exists and what is desired but not yet realized.

* Writing in Org-Mode

Posts are written in [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], a powerful markup language native to Emacs. The benefits:

- *Plain text* that remains readable in any editor
- *Structural editing* with outlining and folding
- *Export flexibility* to HTML, PDF, and other formats
- *Literate programming* support for code examples

This aligns with the blog's philosophy: clarity over cleverness, durability over trends.

* Example Code Block

Here's a simple example in Python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def threshold_state(system):
    """Detect if a system is in a liminal state."""
    if not system.has_stable_invariants():
        return "liminal"
    return "stable"
#+END_SRC

Code blocks render with syntax highlighting and minimal styling.

* Lists and Structure

Things to consider when writing:

1. Assume technical sophistication in the reader
2. Name tradeoffs explicitly rather than hiding them
3. Connect technical specifics to broader judgments
4. Avoid beginner explanations unless explicitly relevant

Bullet points for desiderata:

- Clarity
- Precision
- Intellectual honesty
- Long-term coherence

* Conclusion

This example post demonstrates the basic structure. Real posts will explore distributed systems, abstraction, career decisions, and other topics at the intersection of technical design and human judgment.

The goal is durable thinking, not hot takes.
