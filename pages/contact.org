* Get in Touch

I'm interested in conversations about distributed systems, technical leadership, and the intersection of engineering and judgment.

** Email

The best way to reach me is via email: =your-email@example.com=

(Replace with your actual email address)

** Social

- GitHub: [[https://github.com/eapolinario][github.com/eapolinario]]
- LinkedIn: (Add your LinkedIn URL)
- Twitter/X: (Add if you use it)

** What I'm Interested In

Good topics for conversation:
- Distributed systems design and tradeoffs
- Technical leadership and career development
- Infrastructure and tooling decisions
- Feedback on posts or ideas for future topics
- Speaking opportunities or collaborations

** What I'm Not Great At

I receive more email than I can meaningfully respond to. I try to reply to thoughtful messages, but I may not be able to engage with:
- General networking requests without context
- Unsolicited promotions or marketing
- Requests that don't relate to the blog's themes

If you've read something here that resonated or challenged you, I'd genuinely like to hear about it.
