* About Liminal Desiderata

This blog explores the thresholds between systems design and human judgment, between engineering tradeoffs and values, between what exists and what is desired but not yet realized.

** What This Is

/Liminal Desiderata/ is a collection of technical essays and personal philosophy aimed at experienced engineers, technical leaders, and reflective practitioners. The writing assumes familiarity with software systems, tradeoffs, and abstraction.

Topics include:
- Distributed systems and infrastructure design
- Abstraction, invariants, and failure modes
- Career decisions and technical leadership
- Tooling, productivity, and taste
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Values encoded in systems

** The Name

*Liminal* comes from the Latin /līmen/ ("threshold"). It refers to transitional or in-between states—periods where invariants are suspended and moments before structure hardens into decisions.

*Desiderata* is the plural of /desideratum/—"things desired but not yet attained." These are articulated desired properties or outcomes that guide tradeoff discussions rather than end them.

Together, *Liminal Desiderata* captures the named things we want while we are between stable states.

** Approach

The writing here:
- Connects technical specifics to broader judgments
- Names tradeoffs explicitly rather than hiding them
- Assumes technical sophistication in readers
- Optimizes for long-term intellectual coherence, not virality
- Treats design and life decisions as structurally similar problems
